Architecture summary
This Spring Boot application uses both MVC and REST controllers. Thymeleaf templates are used for
the Admin and Doctor dashboards, while REST APIs serve all other modules. The application interacts with two
databasesâ€”MySQL (for patient, doctor, appointment, and admin data) and MongoDB (for prescriptions). All
controllers route requests through a common service layer, which in turn delegates to the appropriate
repositories. MySQL uses JPA entities while MongoDB uses document models.

Numbered flow of data and control
1. User accesses AdminDashboard or Appointment pages.
2. The action is routed to the appropriate Thymeleaf or REST controller.
3. The controller calls the service layer
4. The service layer communicates with the Repository Layer to perform data access operations. (includes two MySQL repositories and MongoDB repository)
5. Each repository interfaces directly with the underlying database engine to access data
6. Model binding stage Once data is retrieved from the database, it is mapped into Java model classes that the application can work with
7. Finally, the bound models are used in the response layer
